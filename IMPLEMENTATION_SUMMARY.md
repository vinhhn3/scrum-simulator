## 🔮 Future Enhancements (Phase 9 - Optional)

The following features were planned but not yet implemented:

### Potential Additions

- [ ] AI-generated user stories
- [ ] Random sprint challenges (bugs, capacity changes)
- [ ] Performance scoring system
- [ ] Export reports (PDF/CSV)
- [ ] Team personality profiles
- [ ] Advanced analytics dashboard
- [ ] Multi-project support
- [ ] Dark mode
- [ ] Accessibility improvements

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Simplified Daily Scrum**: Uses "Simulate Day" button rather than time-based automation
2. **No Task Breakdown**: Stories don't break into smaller tasks
3. **Static Team**: Team members don't change capacity or availability
4. **No Dependencies**: Stories are independent (no blocking relationships)
5. **Single User**: No multi-user collaboration features

These limitations are intentional to keep the simulator focused on core Scrum learning.

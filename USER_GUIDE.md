# üéì Scrum Simulator - User Guide

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. First Launch

When you first open the Scrum Simulator, you'll see the Dashboard with role selection.

**Choose Your Role:**

- **Product Owner** - Focus on backlog management and prioritization
- **Scrum Master** - Facilitate ceremonies and track metrics
- **Developer** - Work on tasks and complete stories

### 2. Your First Sprint

#### A. Sprint Planning (5 minutes)

1. Click **"Product Backlog"** in the navigation
2. Review the 10 pre-loaded user stories
3. Click **"Move to Sprint ‚Üí"** on 3-4 stories (aim for 15-25 points)
4. Navigate to **"Sprint Planning"**
5. Enter a sprint goal (e.g., "Build core user authentication features")
6. Click **"üöÄ Start Sprint"**

#### B. Sprint Execution (3 minutes)

1. Go to **"Sprint Board"**
2. Drag stories from **To Do** ‚Üí **In Progress** ‚Üí **Done**
3. Click **"‚è≠Ô∏è Simulate Day"** multiple times to progress
4. Watch the progress bar and burndown data update
5. Continue until 80%+ stories are in **Done**

#### C. Sprint Review (2 minutes)

1. Navigate to **"Sprint Review"**
2. Review completed stories
3. Click **"‚úì Accept"** or **"‚úó Needs Revision"** for each story
4. View your sprint metrics (completion rate, velocity, etc.)
5. Click **"Complete Review & Continue to Retrospective"**

#### D. Sprint Retrospective (2 minutes)

1. Fill in the three sections:
   - üòä What Went Well?
   - üòü What Didn't Go Well?
   - üöÄ What Can We Improve?
2. Use **"üí° Suggestion"** buttons for ideas
3. Click **"Complete Retrospective"**
4. You're ready to plan your next sprint!

### 3. Understanding Metrics

After completing 2-3 sprints, visit the **Metrics** page to see:

- **Velocity Chart**: Points completed per sprint
- **Burndown Chart**: Daily progress in current sprint
- **Insights**: Average velocity, trends, and patterns

## Common Workflows

### Adding a New User Story

1. Go to **Product Backlog**
2. Click **"+ Add User Story"**
3. Fill in:
   - Title (e.g., "Password Reset Feature")
   - Description (As a [user], I want [action] so that [benefit])
   - Story Points (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, or 21)
   - Acceptance Criteria
4. Click **"Create Story"**

### Managing Sprint Backlog

- **During Planning**: Move stories from Product Backlog to Sprint Backlog
- **During Sprint**: Stories automatically stay in Sprint Backlog
- **After Sprint**: Incomplete stories return to Product Backlog

### Simulating Team Progress

- Use **"Simulate Day"** button on Sprint Board
- Each click represents one day of work
- Stories randomly progress based on probability
- More realistic than manually moving every story

## Tips for Effective Learning

### üéØ Sprint Planning Tips

- Don't over-commit! Start with 3-4 stories
- Consider team capacity (shown in Sprint Planning)
- Make sprint goals specific and measurable
- Ensure stories have clear acceptance criteria

### üèÉ During Sprint

- Update story status regularly (or use Simulate Day)
- Monitor the burndown chart
- Incomplete stories are okay - it's part of learning!

### üéØ Sprint Review Best Practices

- Only accept stories that meet acceptance criteria
- Be honest about what's "Done" vs. "Almost Done"
- Incomplete work returns to backlog automatically

### üí≠ Retrospective Insights

- Be specific: "Better story estimation" vs. "We need to improve"
- Action-oriented: What will you do differently next sprint?
- Track improvements: Review past retros before planning

### üìä Using Metrics

- **Velocity stabilizes** after 3-4 sprints
- **Burndown** should roughly follow the ideal line
- **Trends** matter more than individual sprint results
- Use data to inform planning, not as pressure

## Keyboard Shortcuts

None currently - all interactions are point-and-click!

## Troubleshooting

### Stories won't move to Sprint Backlog

- You can only add stories when NO sprint is active
- Complete current sprint first, then add more stories

### Can't start a sprint

- Ensure at least one story is in Sprint Backlog
- Enter a sprint goal before clicking Start Sprint

### Metrics page is empty

- Complete at least one full sprint to see velocity data
- Burndown chart only shows during active sprints

### Want to start over?

- Click **üîÑ Reset** in the navigation bar
- Confirms before deleting all data
- Sample stories and team will reload

## Educational Value

### What You'll Learn

1. **Sprint Rhythm**: Planning ‚Üí Execution ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Retrospective
2. **Estimation**: How story points and velocity work together
3. **Prioritization**: Making trade-offs in backlog management
4. **Empiricism**: Using data to improve (burndown, velocity)
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Retrospectives drive change

### Experiment With

- **Over-committing**: Add 50+ points to a sprint. What happens to velocity?
- **Under-committing**: Only 2-3 stories. Is this efficient?
- **Consistency**: Try to complete similar points each sprint
- **Different Roles**: See how PO, SM, and Dev perspectives differ

## Real-World Differences

This simulator simplifies some aspects:

| Simulator           | Real World                                     |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Simulate Day button | Actual daily standup meetings                  |
| Drag & drop stories | Collaborative task board (physical or digital) |
| Pre-defined team    | Team formation, skills, vacation, etc.         |
| No bugs or blockers | Real impediments and technical debt            |
| Instant feedback    | Stakeholder communication and approval         |

## Next Steps

After mastering the basics:

1. Complete 5+ sprints to see meaningful trends
2. Try different sprint durations
3. Experiment with story point distributions
4. Create your own custom user stories
5. Share findings with your team!

## Getting Help

- Review tooltips and tips throughout the app
- Consult the main README.md for technical details
- Check browser console for any errors
- Reset and try again - it's a safe learning environment!
